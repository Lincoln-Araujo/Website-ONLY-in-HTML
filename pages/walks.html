        <p>One thing I love to do after a entire day of work is to go for a nice walk outside.</p>
        <p>But, some days a I'm so full of energy and I do walks a little more audacious.</p>
        <p>Let me tell you about them:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>Walking in the city</h2>
                <img src="../images/walking_city.png" alt="walking in the city"/>
                <p>Walking between buildings and houses is somehting that I do constantly.</p>
                <p>It's a perfect way to relax at the end of the day and organize all my thoughts after a long and hard day.</p>
                <p>It is also the best way to get to know new places while traveling.</p>
            <p></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Walking in the woods</h2>
                <img src="../images/walking_woods.png" alt="walking in the woods"/>
                <p>Sometimes, hiking in the woods is the best way to recharge and feel better, especially when I'm feeling down.</p>
                <p>This is a chance for appreciating some nature landscapes and also to get some fresh air.</p>
                <p>However, it can be a little dangerous depending on the daytime.</p>
            <p></p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h2>Walking in the mountains</h2>
                <img src="../images/walking_mountains.png" alt="walking in the mountains"/>
                <p>I can't say this is the best kind of walk (IT IS!), but I always have the best experiences when I do them.</p>
                <p>I love the feeling of seeing everything from the top of a mountain.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
